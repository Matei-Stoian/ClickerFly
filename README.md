# ClickerFly

ClickerFly is a simple app that allows you to control the computer mouse pointer from your phone via websockets.

## TODO'S

Things I might implement in the future:

- [ ] multiple monitor support
- [ ] device discovery system (maybe mDNS or something)
- [ ] a list of most used devices for ease of use
- [ ] improve UI
